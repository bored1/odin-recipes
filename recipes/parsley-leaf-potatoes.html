        <em>Delightful and cute Parsley Leaf Potatoes</em>
        <br>
        <p>
            From Deb @ <a href="https://www.smittenkitchen.com">Smitten Kitchen</a>: As you may have 
            noticed, as the week’s progressed, things have gotten simpler. We started with great 
            ambitions — we will make a green bean casserole from scratch! We will trim the beans! 
            make a roux! sauté the mushrooms! coat and deep-fry the onions! We moved onto my favorite 
            stuffing made from torn baguettes, diced apples and onions and celery, three herbs, 
            sometimes cornbread, sometimes sausage; it’s a two-pan ordeal. We slipped quietly into 
            the simple weeknight savior, cauliflower and brown butter breadcrumbs. At the rate we’re 
            going, I’ll have a boiled water recipe on the site by Monday. But somewhere between 
            five-ingredient breadcrumbs and recipes that don’t need to be spelled out, there’s this, 
            a potato recipe with only salt, butter and parsley.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ounces unsalted butter</li>
            <li>8 small-medium baking potatoes, scrubbed</li>
            <li>16 fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</li>
            <li>Coarse salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Place roasting pan in oven with butter; once butter has melted, just a minute or two later, 
                remove pan from oven. </li>
            <li>alve each potato lengthwise. Place one parsley leaf in the center of each cut half, then 
                sprinkle cut sides generously with salt. </li>
            <li>Arrange face-down in pan with melted butter; try not to nudge them around or the leaves will 
                move (as mine did) off-center. Roast potatoes for 35 to 45 minutes (depending on size) until tender. </li>
        </ol>
